In particular, he&#x27;s interested in learning about and possibly pursuing a career in computer security.<p>He&#x27;s concerned, however, as he&#x27;s 48 years old and has little background in information technology.<p>For the past decade or so he&#x27;s been running a small convenience store well enough to support himself and his family.<p>So, I ask you whether you think he has a chance at getting into the industry, given his age and background. Do you think it would be worth him getting a qualification in cybersecurity? Do you think he&#x27;d have much of a chance getting a job?<p>Thanks :)",
